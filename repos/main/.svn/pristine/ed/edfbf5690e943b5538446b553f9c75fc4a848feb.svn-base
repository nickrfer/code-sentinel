/** 
 * Interface for all compiler directives (e.g. include and goal patterns).
 * 
 * <p>There are two kinds of directives: single directive and begin/end directive. 
 * The single directive does not have inner plans, as, for instance, the 
 * include:
 * <br/><code>
 *     ...<br>
 *     { include("a.asl") } <br>
 *     ...<br>
 * </code><br/>
 * 
 * <p>begin/end directives have inner plans, as used in goal patterns:
 * <br/><code>
 *     ...<br>
 *     { begin ebdg(g) } <br>
 *     +!g : bel <- action1. <br>
 *     +!g       <- action2. <br>
 *     { end } <br>
 *     ...<br>
 * </code><br/>
 * This pattern will change these two plans to:
 * <br/><code>
 *     +!g : g. <br>
 *     +!g : not (p__1(g)) & bel <- +p__1(g); action1; ?g. <br>
 *     +!g : not (p__2(g))       <- +p__2(g); action2; ?g. <br>
 *     -!g <- !g. <br>
 *      +g <- -p__1(g); -p__2(g); .dropGoal(g,true). <br>
 * </code><br/>
 * 
 * Goal patterns are proposed in the paper: <br> 
 * <br/> 
 * Jomi Fred Hubner, Rafael H. Bordini, and Michael Wooldridge. <br>
 * Programming declarative goals using plan patterns. <br> In Matteo
 * Baldoni and Ulle Endriss, editors, <i>Proceedings of the Fourth
 * International Workshop on Declarative Agent Languages and
 * Technologies</i> (DALT 2006), held with AAMAS 2006, 8th May, Hakodate,
