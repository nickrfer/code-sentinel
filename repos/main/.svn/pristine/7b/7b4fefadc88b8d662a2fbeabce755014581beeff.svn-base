/**
  <p>Internal action:
  <b><code>.fail_goal(<i>G</i>)</code></b>.
  
  <p>Description: aborts goals <i>G</i> in the agent circumstance as if a plan
  for such goal had failed. Assuming that one of the plans requiring <i>G</i> was 
  <code>G0 &lt;- !G; ...</code>, an event <code>-!G0</code> is generated. In
  case <i>G</i> was triggered by <code>!!G</code> (and therefore
  not a subgoal, as happens also when an "achieve" performative is used),
  the generated event is <code>-!G</code>.  A literal <i>G</i>
  is a goal if there is a triggering event <code>+!G</code> in any plan within
  any intention; also note that intentions can be suspended hence appearing
  in sets E, PA, or PI of the agent's circumstance as well.
  <br/>
  The meta-event <code>^!G[state(failed)]</code> is produced. 

  <p>Example:<ul> 

  <li> <code>.fail_goal(go(1,3))</code>: aborts any attempt to achieve
  goals such as <code>!go(1,3)</code> as if a plan for it had failed. Assuming that
  it is a subgoal in the plan <code>get_gold(X,Y) &lt;- go(X,Y); pick.</code>, the
  generated event is <code>-!get_gold(1,3)</code>.

  </ul>

  (Note: this internal action was introduced in a DALT 2006 paper, where it was called .dropGoal(G,false).)
